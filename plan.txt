The main functionality of actually placing pieces is now intact

The main difference with this set from the previous playground is the fully functioning grid

Marking hits and misses is intact

While much of the game is complete, we still need to add

1. an efficient way of preventing board wrap-around
2. game loss functions
3. a streamlined user interface and user experience
4. sinking ships
5. setting the ship number
6. Fully functioning reset that brings back the pieces as well 
(only clearing the board of hits and misses is complete)
7. Not allowing shots fired before pieces are placed
